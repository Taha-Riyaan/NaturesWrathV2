      general: 'Earthquakes occur when rocks break and slip along faults in the Earth and release energy. Seismic waves emanate out in all directions and cause the ground to shake, sometimes hundreds of kilometres away. A strong, damaging earthquake is often followed by aftershocks.  ',
      areasOfOccurance: 'Coastal British Columbia experiences the largest and most frequent Canadian earthquakes including offshore events that may cause tsunamis. The St. Lawrence and Ottawa River valleys of southern Quebec and southeastern Ontario are also at risk of dangerous earthquake shaking. Large earthquakes occur across Canadaâ€™s three northern territories. Atlantic Canada is also exposed to earthquakes and has experienced tsunamis. Earthquakes in the United States that occur near Canada in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, or the Atlantic Northeast may also cause shaking in Canada. Indigenous Peoples across Canada have passed down earthquake knowledge through oral tradition for thousands of years.',
      safetyMeasures: "To prepare for an earthquake, create an emergency kit, make a household emergency plan, and ensure everyone knows what to do during an earthquake. Secure heavy furniture, appliances, and objects to prevent them from tipping or falling. During an earthquake, remember to drop, take cover, and hold on. If outdoors, move to an open area, and if in a vehicle, pull over safely and stay inside. After the shaking stops, be ready for aftershocks, check for hazards, and follow emergency officials' instructions.",
