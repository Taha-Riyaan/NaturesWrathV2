        general: 'An avalanche occurs when a mass of snow releases from a slope and flows downhill. Avalanches are a natural part of the mountainous environment; hundreds of thousands of avalanches occur in Canada every year. \n Avalanches are directly tied to terrain, such as a steep slope. Once in motion, avalanches can also run onto flat terrain and even uphill.',
        areasOfOccurance: 'Avalanches are most frequent in the mountains of British Columbia, Yukon, and Alberta, but avalanche fatalities have also occurred across the country. Inuit and northern communities may experience more frequent and intense avalanches in the future due to climate change.',
        safetyMeasures: 'To prepare for an avalanche, ensure you have an emergency vehicle kit, understand avalanche terrain and weather factors, and recognize signs of elevated avalanche risk. Never travel alone in such areas, and always check avalanche forecasts. For road safety, heed avalanche control warnings and avoid stopping in avalanche zones. For outdoor recreation, get trained, carry essential avalanche equipment, and know how to perform companion rescues. If caught in an avalanche, try to escape, stay afloat, and create an air pocket. After an avalanche, report the incident and seek professional safety assessments.',
