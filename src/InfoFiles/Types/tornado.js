      general: 'Tornadoes are rotating columns of high winds. Sometimes they move quickly (up to 70 km/hour) and leave a long, wide path of destruction. At other times the tornado is small, touching down here and there. Large or small, they can uproot trees, flip cars and demolish houses. Tornadoes usually hit in the afternoon and early evening, but they have been known to strike at night too.',

For those on a farm, prioritize your safety first and only open gates for livestock if you have time. In office buildings or apartments, move to an inner hallway or basement, avoiding elevators and windows. Large buildings with wide-span roofs are risky; if possible, relocate to a safer building. If you’re in a car or mobile home, avoid these; find solid shelter or lie in a ditch if necessary. While driving, seek shelter or lie low in a ditch, staying away from tornadoes and debris.',
