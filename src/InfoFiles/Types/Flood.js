      general: 'Flooding is Canada’s most costly and frequent natural hazard. Floods can occur at any time of year and can be caused by events such as heavy rainfall, melting snow, ice jams, coastal storm surges, tsunamis, seiches, tidal events, and groundwater flooding. Flooding is a natural process that can be helpful in nature, but flooding becomes dangerous when it affects populated areas.',
      areasOfOccurance: 'Floods can occur in any region and most of Canada’s population lives in areas that are at risk of flooding. Over 80% of people in Canada live in urban areas, and about 80% of major Canadian cities are located wholly or partially in flood zones.',
      safetyMeasures: 'To prepare for a flood, start by assembling an emergency kit and making a household emergency plan tailored to the needs of everyone in your household. Learn about local flood risks and consider flood insurance if possible. Prepare your home by securing important documents, using sandbags to prevent water entry, and ensuring your home has flood prevention measures like proper grading and a sump pump. Keep your vehicle fueled and equipped with an emergency kit. During a flood, avoid floodwaters, heed local advisories, and operate generators safely. If evacuation is necessary, take your emergency kit and follow official routes. After a flood, wait for official clearance before returning, inspect and clean up damage, and ensure your home and water sources are safe.',
