      safetyMeasures: 'To prepare for a tsunami, inspect and fortify your home against flooding, and store important documents above ground. Learn how to turn off utilities, and ensure your emergency kit is portable and includes first aid supplies. Watch for tsunami warning signs such as prolonged earthquakes or unusual water receding. Upon receiving a tsunami warning, move to higher ground immediately. During the tsunami, stay away from the shore, take refuge indoors if evacuation isn’t possible, and remain there until authorities confirm it’s safe. Be cautious of dangerous floodwaters and potential health risks like hypothermia.',
